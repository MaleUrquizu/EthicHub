[EthicHub](https://ethix.ethichub.com/)  is a growing company that facilitates financing for small producers in countries like Mexico and Honduras through a crowdlending platform. It is the first agrotech company operating on the blockchain, incorporating a compensation system built on the ethix: their own token. Their mission is to create a triple impact: social, financial, and environmental.

## Requirements for our MVP
The project must be developed in react.js. The main goal is to improve the CRM dashboard for EthicHub, which relies on blockchain data metrics. The improvements should focus on enhancing the UI and making data presentation more effective. We are starting with the Bonds page, as suggested in the following screenshot:
